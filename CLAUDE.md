## Project Purpose

Enterprise architecture reference project modeling **Monsters, Inc.** (Pixar) using the full open semantic web and EA standards stack. It is both a learning resource and a demonstration artifact for **MS IQ** — an intelligent enterprise modeling platform designed to import and reason over these open formats.

The semantic artifacts themselves (the `ontologies/`, `shapes/`, `mappings/`, and `queries/` files), together with this `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`, are the live source of truth. The original brief is preserved for reference at `.claude/prompts/spec.md` (canonical domain knowledge, entity definitions, business rules) and `.claude/prompts/PROMPT.md` (per-artifact content requirements). That brief predates the 2026 agent-grade additions (docs 13–15, the agent/governance/constitution/motivation ontologies), so treat it as historical context — not current inventory.

## Commands

Once `pyproject.toml` exists (generated as part of the project build):

```bash
uv sync                  # install dependencies (rdflib, pyshacl, rich, typer)
make all                 # seed → generate ontology → validate SHACL → run queries
make ontology            # uv run mi-ontology  → merges the 9 ontologies → build/mi-merged.ttl (+ live counts)
make seed                # uv run mi-seed      → writes data/seed_graph.ttl
make validate            # uv run mi-validate  → SHACL report (expects 3 intentional violations, named)
make query               # uv run mi-query     → business questions Q1–Q22
make query-cv            # compliance · make query-agent · make query-human · make query-gov · make query-con
make test                # detector unit tests — isolated fixtures for CV5/CV6/CV3 (runs inside `make all`)
make materialize         # execute the R2RML mapping (SQLite + morph-kgc) and verify it joins the seed graph
make drift               # verify docs excerpts still match their source-of-truth files
make catalog             # uv run mi-catalog   → builds DCAT catalog from data assets → build/mi-catalog.generated.ttl
```

To run a single script directly:
```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_shacl.py
uv run python scripts/run_queries.py --query Q1
```

To check a Turtle file parses cleanly:
```python
import rdflib; g = rdflib.Graph(); g.parse("ontologies/mi-core.ttl", format="turtle")
```

## Architecture

The project has three layers that build on each other:

### 1. Documentation (`docs/`)
16 markdown files (00–15), each covering one modeling view. Every document must include: a `View / Standard / Audience` header block, a navigation bar, at least one PlantUML diagram, at least one Turtle/SPARQL/SHACL code artifact, a "Why this matters" section, and cross-references to related docs. Diagrams use **PlantUML** exclusively (not Mermaid).

### 2. Semantic Artifacts
| Path | Standard | What it models |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `ontologies/mi-core.ttl` | OWL 2 | 12 core entity classes (plus the abstract `mi:Canister` superclass and legacy `mi:ScreamCanister`), supporting enumerations, and properties — the central schema |
| `ontologies/mi-glossary.ttl` | SKOS | 52 controlled-vocabulary concepts under 7 top concepts |
| `ontologies/mi-catalog.ttl` | DCAT 3 | Catalog of all 11 data assets |
| `ontologies/mi-provenance.ttl` | PROV-O | Laugh→canister→energy→grid lineage chain |
| `ontologies/mi-process.ttl` | OWL + BPMN-O | 7 business processes with semantic annotations |
| `ontologies/mi-agent-model.ttl` | OWL 2 | Authority, permissions, HITL triggers, `mi:automatable` per step |
| `ontologies/mi-motivation.ttl` | OWL 2 | Goals/drivers/capabilities — strategy→capability→process chain |
| `ontologies/mi-governance.ttl` | OWL 2 + W3C ODRL | Identity, RDF service catalog, ODRL access policies, data classification |
| `ontologies/mi-constitution.ttl` | OWL 2 | Principles → regulatory requirements → enforcement bindings |
| `shapes/mi-core.shacl.ttl` | SHACL | Core property/cardinality constraint shapes |
| `shapes/mi-compliance.shacl.ttl` | SHACL | CDA-specific regulatory constraint shapes |
| `shapes/mi-agent.shacl.ttl` | SHACL | Permission / HITL / high-severity escalation constraint shapes |
| `mappings/mi-db.r2rml.ttl` | R2RML | Maps the operational SQL tables (COMEDIAN, CHILD_DOOR, PERFORMANCE_RECORD, …) to RDF |
| `queries/business-questions.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 22 analytical business queries (Q1–Q22) |
| `queries/compliance-violations.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 7 queries mirroring SHACL constraints (CV1–CV7) |
| `queries/agent-authority.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 5 agent-authority queries (AA1–AA5) |
| `queries/human-centered.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 8 human-centered / wellbeing queries (HC1–HC8) |
| `queries/governance.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 6 data-governance queries (GV1–GV6) |
| `queries/constitution.sparql` | SPARQL 1.1 | 4 constitution / defensibility queries (CN1–CN4) |

### 3. Python / UV Project (`scripts/`)
Nine Python files in `scripts/` (`__init__.py` plus eight modules). Five are wired as CLI entry points via `pyproject.toml` (`mi-seed`, `mi-ontology`, `mi-validate`, `mi-query`, `mi-catalog`); `check_doc_drift`, `run_tests`, and `materialize_r2rml` are invoked via their `make` targets. Execution order matters: `seed_data` first (populates `data/seed_graph.ttl`), then `generate_ontology`, then `validate_shacl` (loads seed + the ontologies the shapes target, including `mi-provenance.ttl`), then `run_queries` (loads all ontologies + seed into one graph). `run_tests` exercises the dormant detectors (CV5/CV6/CV3) against isolated in-memory fixtures without touching the seed; `check_doc_drift` verifies doc excerpts against their source files.

## Key Conventions

**Ontology URI base:** `https://vocab.monstersinc.com/ontology#`, prefix `mi:`  
**SKOS glossary URI:** `https://vocab.monstersinc.com/glossary`

**Class naming:** PascalCase OWL class names map directly to database table names (COMEDIAN → `mi:Comedian`). The 12 core classes are listed in `.claude/prompts/spec.md §6`.

**Cross-domain concern:** CDA compliance (D5) is a cross-cutting concern — it touches D1, D2, and D3. Any process or shape affecting those domains must include a CDA compliance check or reference.

**Intentional SHACL violations in seed data:** `seed_data.py` deliberately creates three violations: (1) a Comedian without valid certification (Randall Boggs), (2) a ChildDoor with stale maintenance (NYC-0099), and (3) a CDA incident reported >30 minutes after detection. `make validate` should show exactly 3 violations and name each — this is the expected state. `validate_shacl.py` asserts them by identity (not a magic count), so adding shapes won't falsely fail the check.

**Agent-grade modules (2026 council remediation):** beyond the original 12-class core, the model now includes `ontologies/mi-agent-model.ttl` (authority, permissions, HITL triggers, `mi:automatable` per step), `mi-motivation.ttl` (goals/drivers/capabilities — strategy→process chain), `mi-governance.ttl` (identity, service catalog as RDF, W3C ODRL access policies, data classification), and `mi-constitution.ttl` (principles → regulatory requirements → enforcement bindings). Query suites: `queries/{agent-authority,human-centered,governance,constitution}.sparql`. Docs `13`–`15` cover these. Docs carry short marked excerpts (not full copies) of source files — run `make drift` after editing a doc's code block.

**Diagram format:** All diagrams are PlantUML. Use `!theme plain` and `skinparam backgroundColor #FFFFFF` as baseline styling for consistency across all documents.

**Six domains (D1–D6):** D2 (Laugh Operations) is the core value-creating domain. All other domains either feed into it or regulate it. When in doubt about domain ownership of an entity, trace back to which domain it most directly enables.

          (motivation chain: ontologies/mi-motivation.ttl)
scripts/ → eight modules: 5 CLI entry points (mi-seed/-ontology/-validate/-query/-catalog)
           + check_doc_drift + run_tests + materialize_r2rml
